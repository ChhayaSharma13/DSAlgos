    <h1>Big O Notations</h1>

    <!-- Big O notation allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as  input grows -->
    <!-- An algorithm is o(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do eventually less than a constant f(n) as n increases-->
    
    <!-- f(n) could be linear, quadratic or constant e.g.
        f(n) = n, f(n) = n*n, f(n) =1
    -->
    <!-- Big O notation gives numerical representation of performance of code -->
    <!-- 1. Faster
         2. Less memory-intensive -->

    <!-- It could be check(roughly) by counting no. of operations in any code -->
    <!-- But it can be tedious to count operations -->
